You will see in the next chapter why the raw dataset is the one working the best.

You see, your “professional” friend wasn’t so pro after all and mistakenly did not erased the red dot correctly. It’s not visible with the naked eye but that computer absolutely picked up that difference in color by 0.40% on the bottom right corner of your images of ill patients.

As you cannot create information out of nothing he just replaced the red dot by the mean color below it.

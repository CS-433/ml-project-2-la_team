Now you are going to feed your modified dataset to a machine learning algorithm. 

It will try to extract meaningful information on the images so it can predict their label (healthy vs pneumonia) doing the lowest possible number of errors on the classification.

Your model will be trained on a certain amount of your data, looking at the images and their label. 

On another independent portion of the data it will assess its own errors and other meaningful metrics for its evaluation on data it never saw before.
